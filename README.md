# Description


This project is focused on building an API. It uses Rails and ActiveRecord to build an API that exposed our dataset in JSON. The data comes in the form of many CSV files, which I pulled into the application and created objects in order to store the information in my database. Once the data was useable, I had to create multilple endpoints that exposed specific data about each of the resourses. This project also involved advanced ActiveRecord queries to join multible data tables for exposing business intelligence data about different resources. 

# Local Setup


Visit https://github.com/cjkelling/rales_engine and clone down the repo. Once you have cloned the project onto your local computer, open a text editor like Atom, and bundle to add the gemfile to your system. This will enable you to work on the user interface side of the application.
